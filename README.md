# FeatureSelector
**House Price Prediction Model**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on given features.

Dataset
The dataset used is the "Advanced Regression" dataset provided by Kaggle. The dataset contains various features of residential homes and their sale prices.

Feature Engineering
The dataset was put through various feature engineering techniques before being used in the machine learning model. These techniques include:

Missing data imputation
Categorical variable encoding
Outlier handling
Feature scaling
Feature selection
Models
The machine learning model used in this project is Linear Regression.

Performance
The model achieved an R2 score of 0.85 on the test set.
